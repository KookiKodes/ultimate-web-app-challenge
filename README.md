# ultimate-web-app-challenge
The Ultimate Web App Challenge:  Designed to challenge you using different kinds of front-end frameworks and languages over the period of several weeks. We first start with building very basic apps, such as a simmple clicker app, a note app, a todo app, etc.... The apps will progress in difficulty as time progresses.
